## Plotly-challenge

An interactive dashboard was created using javascript, plotly, css, and html to explore the belly button biodiversity dataset (http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/) which catalogs the microbs that colonize human navels. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.
